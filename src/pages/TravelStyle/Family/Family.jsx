          We don’t believe “let’s have kids” should mean you have to stop exploring the world.
           We also don’t believe you should get home from a holiday just as tired as when you left.
            So we have real parents at B&R design and test-drive everything.
             Our resulting journeys get rave reviews from young and young-at-heart people alike.
              Nothing’s dumbed-down, everything’s 100% stress-free, 
              and there’s always as much action and excitement as the kids can handle.
